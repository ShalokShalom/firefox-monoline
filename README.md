## To do

- [ ] right-align extension icons
	- [ ] create a variable in order to easily change spacing according to how many extensions appear in the toolbar
- [ ] use attributes selectors in order to change spacing according to whether the downloads icon is displayed
- [ ] show some necessary `#titlebar-buttonbox`
- [ ] evaluate behavior with non-compact mode
	- [ ] create a variable to toggle spacing for compact/non-compact mode
- [ ] understand why `#urlbar[breakout][breakout-extend]` `top` and `left` styles do not work.
